"As a low-income Black man in an urban area, I believe healthcare reform is essential to address systemic inequities. Low-income communities often face inadequate care and higher rates of chronic illness. I support universal healthcare to ensure everyone, regardless of income or race, has access to quality care. We also need policies that tackle implicit bias in the healthcare system."
