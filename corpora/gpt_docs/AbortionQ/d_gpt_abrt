"As a high-income, non-binary Asian individual living in a rural area, I believe in the importance of reproductive rights, including access to safe and legal abortion. Coming from a rural area, I recognize that accessing healthcare, especially reproductive care, can be challenging. For me, bodily autonomy and the ability to make choices about one's own health are essential. Culturally, perspectives on abortion can vary widely within Asian communities, but I support policies that empower individuals rather than impose restrictions based on geography or socioeconomic status."
