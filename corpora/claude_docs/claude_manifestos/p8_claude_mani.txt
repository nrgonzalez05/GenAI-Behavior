Living Rural, Living True: A Vision for Inclusive Rural Justice

As a Black non-binary person in rural America, my politics emerge from intersecting experiences of marginalization and community resilience. My vision combines agricultural justice, racial equity, and LGBTQ+ liberation.

Rural healthcare access is critical. Our community lacks adequate medical facilities, especially LGBTQ+-affirming and culturally competent care. We need Medicare for All with specific provisions for rural areas, including mobile health units and telehealth infrastructure. Trans healthcare must be accessible regardless of location.

Food sovereignty links to liberation. Industrial agriculture exploits Black and brown workers while destroying small farms. We need land reform addressing historical theft of Black-owned farmland, support for minority farmers, and investment in sustainable agriculture. Food assistance programs should cover fresh, local produce.

Rural infrastructure requires transformation. Our communities need reliable internet, public transportation, and green energy investment. The digital divide perpetuates educational and economic inequalities. Infrastructure projects must prioritize Black and minority rural communities historically denied resources.

Education must serve all rural youth. Schools need funding for LGBTQ+-inclusive curricula, Black history, and agricultural science. Distance learning options and trade programs should expand opportunities while letting youth remain in rural communities.

Criminal justice reform is crucial. Rural police departments need accountability and anti-bias training. We must end the school-to-prison pipeline and discriminatory enforcement. Rural jails shouldn't profit from our communities' pain.

Environmental justice affects rural communities first. Black and poor rural areas disproportionately face toxic dumping, factory farming pollution, and climate change impacts. We need Green New Deal policies supporting sustainable rural development and indigenous land management practices.

Gender justice means rural liberation. Non-binary and trans people exist everywhere, not just cities. We need protection from discrimination in housing, employment, and public spaces. Rural LGBTQ+ youth deserve safe spaces and supportive resources.

Economic justice requires rural investment. We need living wages, worker protections, and support for small businesses. Universal basic income could revitalize rural economies. Cooperative ownership models can build community wealth.

Religious freedom must include freedom from religious oppression. Rural LGBTQ+ people often face faith-based discrimination. We need strict separation of church and state while supporting inclusive faith communities.

Housing justice means affordable, quality rural housing without discrimination. Mobile home resident rights need protection. Rural homelessness, especially among LGBTQ+ youth, needs addressing through supportive housing programs.

Gun rights must balance with public safety. Rural gun culture needn't conflict with common-sense regulation. Armed self-defense has historical importance in rural Black communities, but we must address gun violence.

My politics envision rural communities where everyone can thrive authentically. This requires dismantling interconnected systems of racism, homophobia, transphobia, and economic exploitation while building inclusive, sustainable alternatives.

True liberation means nobody has to leave their rural home to live freely. Through collective action and mutual aid, we can create rural spaces that celebrate all identities while stewarding the land for future generations.
