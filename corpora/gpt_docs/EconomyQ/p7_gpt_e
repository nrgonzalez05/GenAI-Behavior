"As a middle-income Native Hawaiian man in an urban area, I believe the economy should reflect the values of equity and sustainability. Hawai'i faces unique challenges, such as high costs of living and reliance on tourism. I support diversifying the economy through investments in renewable energy, agriculture, and education while ensuring fair wages for all workers."
