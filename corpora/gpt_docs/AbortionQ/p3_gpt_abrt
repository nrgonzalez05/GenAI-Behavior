"As a low-income Hispanic woman in an urban area, I support abortion access as a matter of individual and community well-being. Many in Hispanic communities are disproportionately affected by restrictive abortion laws, which can exacerbate poverty and limit opportunities. My stance is rooted in compassion and ensuring that women, regardless of income, have safe, legal options."
