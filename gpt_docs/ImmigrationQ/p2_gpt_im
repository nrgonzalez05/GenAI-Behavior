"As a low-income Black man in an urban area, I understand the challenges that immigrant communities face, as they often overlap with issues of economic inequality. While I support immigration, I believe reforms should also address how immigrant and native-born workers are impacted by labor conditions. Policies should uplift everyone, ensuring fair wages and opportunities for all workers."
