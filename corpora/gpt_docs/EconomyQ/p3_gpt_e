"As a low-income Hispanic woman in an urban area, I believe the economy should work for everyone, especially those in vulnerable positions. Many in my community work tirelessly but struggle to make ends meet. I support raising the minimum wage, affordable childcare, and pathways for small businesses to thrive. Investments in education and healthcare are key to long-term economic stability."
