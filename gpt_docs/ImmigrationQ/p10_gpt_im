"As a middle-income Hispanic man in an urban area, I see immigration as deeply personal and central to our nationâ€™s identity. Many in my community have firsthand experience with the challenges of immigration. I advocate for reforms that prioritize family unity, provide legal pathways, and protect undocumented individuals from exploitation and discrimination."
