"As a low-income Hispanic woman in an urban area, I see healthcare as a basic necessity that too many in my community struggle to afford. Language barriers and lack of insurance often prevent access to care. I advocate for universal healthcare that includes culturally competent services and ensures access to preventive and reproductive health for all."
