"As a middle-income Native Hawaiian man in an urban area, I believe immigration strengthens the U.S. culturally and economically. In Hawai'i, we see the contributions of diverse immigrant communities firsthand. I support policies that honor family unity, respect cultural diversity, and offer fair pathways to citizenship while addressing concerns about overburdened resources."
