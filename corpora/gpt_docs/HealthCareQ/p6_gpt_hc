"As a low-income Native American woman in a rural area, I know firsthand how limited healthcare resources can be, especially on reservations. The Indian Health Service is underfunded and inadequate. I support expanded federal funding for Indigenous healthcare and universal systems that ensure everyone, especially marginalized communities, has access to comprehensive care."
