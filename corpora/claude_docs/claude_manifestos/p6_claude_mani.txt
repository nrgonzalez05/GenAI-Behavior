Our People's Path Forward: A Vision for Indigenous Justice and Renewal

As a Native woman living on reservation land, my political views emerge from lived experience, our people's history, and our hopes for the future. I write this not just as an individual, but as a voice intertwined with my community, my ancestors, and the generations to come.

The foundation of my political beliefs rests on sovereignty - true, meaningful sovereignty for tribal nations. For too long, the federal government has treated tribal sovereignty as a hollow promise while continuing to undermine our self-determination. We need full recognition of our rights to govern ourselves, manage our lands, and preserve our ways of life.

Healthcare is not just a policy issue for me - it's personal. Working at our clinic, I see daily how the Indian Health Service remains chronically underfunded. Our people deserve quality healthcare that honors both modern medicine and our traditional healing practices. The government must fulfill its treaty obligations to provide comprehensive health services to Native communities.

Environmental protection is inseparable from our survival. Our lands face threats from resource extraction, pollution, and climate change. As traditional stewards of these territories, we must have primary authority over environmental decisions affecting our communities. Development projects should require our free, prior, and informed consent. The protection of sacred sites and preservation of clean water must take precedence over corporate profits.

Education is crucial for our children's future while maintaining our cultural identity. Our schools need proper funding and the freedom to teach our languages, histories, and traditions. The devastating legacy of boarding schools shows why we must control our children's education. I support free college education, especially for Native students, to break cycles of poverty while strengthening tribal communities.

Economic development must happen on our terms. We need investment in reservation infrastructure - reliable internet, improved roads, affordable housing. But development should support, not suppress, our traditional ways of life. I advocate for tribal-owned businesses, sustainable agriculture, and renewable energy projects that create jobs while respecting our values.

The epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous women demands immediate action. We need increased funding for tribal law enforcement, restoration of tribal criminal jurisdiction, and better coordination between tribal, state and federal agencies. Violence against Native women is a direct result of historical trauma and continued marginalization.

Voting rights for Native Americans remain under attack through ID requirements, distant polling places, and lack of translation services. We must expand voting access on reservations and ensure our voices count in all elections that affect our lives.

Federal recognition policies need reform to acknowledge all legitimate tribal nations. The current system is overly burdensome and fails to account for how federal policies disrupted many tribes' continuity. Recognition should be based on Indigenous definitions of community and kinship, not colonial standards.

Climate change threatens our traditional foods, medicines, and ways of life. We need bold action to reduce emissions and support tribal climate resilience. Indigenous ecological knowledge should guide environmental policy. Our traditional practices of controlled burns and sustainable harvesting offer wisdom for addressing current challenges.

Reparative justice requires more than apologies. We need return of ancestral lands, protection of sacred sites, and funding to revitalize cultural practices and languages. The government must honor all treaty obligations and provide compensation for historical theft and destruction of Native resources.

Drug and alcohol addiction devastate many reservation communities. Rather than criminalization, we need culturally-informed treatment programs that incorporate traditional healing practices. Intergenerational trauma requires intergenerational healing.

I envision a future where tribal nations are truly sovereign, our cultures thrive, our children prosper, and our traditional knowledge helps heal not just our communities but the whole earth. This requires dismantling systems of colonization while building Indigenous solutions based on our values of reciprocity, responsibility to future generations, and respect for all creation.

These positions emerge from my experiences as a Native woman, mother, and tribal member witnessing both struggles and resilience in my community. They reflect an understanding that personal and political transformation must happen together, guided by Indigenous wisdom and values.
