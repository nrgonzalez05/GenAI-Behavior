"As a high-income white woman in an urban area, I believe in an economy that prioritizes fairness and sustainability. While Iâ€™ve benefitted from economic privilege, I support higher taxes on the wealthy, investments in green energy, and policies that address income inequality. A healthy economy should provide opportunities for everyone to thrive."
