"As a middle-income white woman in an urban area, I support affordable, accessible healthcare for all. Living in a city, I recognize the relative ease of access compared to rural areas, but affordability remains a major barrier for many. I advocate for a public option that ensures coverage while maintaining choice, with an emphasis on mental health and preventive care."
