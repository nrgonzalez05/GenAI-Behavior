"As a middle-income white woman in an urban area, I believe immigration is a cornerstone of the United Statesâ€™ identity. Urban areas thrive on diversity, and I see the contributions of immigrant communities every day. I support reforms that make it easier for people to immigrate legally, protect families, and offer pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Compassion and pragmatism must guide immigration policy."
