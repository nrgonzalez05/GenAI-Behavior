"As a high-income, non-binary Asian individual in a rural area, I believe that healthcare is a fundamental right. Rural communities often face limited access to healthcare services, and Iâ€™ve seen how this disproportionately affects marginalized groups. I support universal healthcare or systems that ensure no one is left behind, with additional investments in rural infrastructure to address geographic disparities."
