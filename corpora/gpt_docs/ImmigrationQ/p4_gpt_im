"As a high-income Asian man in an urban area, I view immigration as essential for economic growth and cultural diversity. Many Asian families, including my own, have benefitted from immigration opportunities. I support expanding legal immigration pathways, addressing backlogs, and ensuring that highly skilled and low-wage workers alike have access to fair opportunities."
