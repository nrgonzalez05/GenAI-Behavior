"As a low-income Hispanic woman in an urban area, I strongly advocate for immigrant rights and protections. Many in my community are immigrants or have immigrant roots, and I see their hard work and resilience daily. We need policies that keep families together, create pathways to citizenship, and protect undocumented individuals from exploitation and fear."
