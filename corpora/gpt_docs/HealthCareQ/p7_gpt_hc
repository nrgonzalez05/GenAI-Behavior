"As a middle-income Native Hawaiian man in an urban area, I believe healthcare should be a right, not a privilege. In Hawai'i, we understand the importance of community and well-being, which must extend to equitable healthcare for all. I support universal healthcare with an emphasis on culturally competent care and preventive health services."
