"As a high-income, non-binary Asian individual in a rural area, I believe the U.S. is a good example of a democracy in principle, but there is room for improvement in practice. The democratic system provides mechanisms for representation and accountability, yet rural areas often feel overlooked in national policies. Additionally, systemic inequities in voting access and campaign financing undermine the ideal of equal representation. Democracy must evolve to be more inclusive and equitable."
