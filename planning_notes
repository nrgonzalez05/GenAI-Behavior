Planning and Notes 


Organizational Things 
  - Seperate Folders for Claude / ChatGPT / Gemini / CoPilot Data 
  - This is a demographic randomizer (https://an.owomoyela.net/fun/demographics_generator, we can set %'s to population % from most recent census?) 
  - Make a list of methods we plan to use or try / explore?
    - Cosine Similarity 
    - word2vec
    - Topic modeling 
  - Sample Size confirmation?
    - 10 Profiles 
    - Manifesto, or series of questions? 
      - If manifesto, 500 or 750 words? 
      - Series of questions, 250 words each tops? 
      - Manifesto on a topic issue, or issue(s), or freeform?
  - Probably have to read that article Oscar mentioned at some point, and its footnotes for more literature.
  - Also have to find some pol behavior articles to conversate with. 
  
  
  Question & Manifesto Ideas 
    - If we do questions, we can do use this (https://apnorc.org/projects/2025-the-publics-priorities-and-expectations/) as a reference/gauge for the public's priorities, or we can use ANES or CCES which are surveys.
    - I am thinking five questions however, on five unqiue topics if we do questions. 
      - "What is your stance on abortion?"
      - "What is your stance on Obama Care?"
      - "How your characterize the current immigration policy in the United States?"
      - "Do you believe that there is increased racial tension in the United States, and if so what are the causes?"
      - "Please explain your positioning on Trans-rights?"
      
Friday we probably have to address all things, almost in final, and begin setting up the AI Accounts and get the demographic profiles.
