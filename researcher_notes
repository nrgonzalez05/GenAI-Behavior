Researchers Notes

- so far claude and gpt gave us disclaimer
- for the manifestos and claude, I had to tweak some of the wording because it wanted to give me bullet points, or not give me a manifesto at all. 
- leaving generic claude settings so concise and 3.5 haiku
- gpt is doing way less than 250 words 
- claude you get about 5 manifestos 
- we're not using anything but the most recent software, so per day capture limits
- So currently at 5/10 Claude Manifestos
- gemini wants to create images.
- This is how I had to ask gemini
  - As this demographic profile, please write a 1000 word political manifesto in ful paragraphs. Race: White Gender: Female Urban: Urban Income: High
- Currently at 9/10 for gemini
