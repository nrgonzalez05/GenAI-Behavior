"As a middle-income white woman in an urban area, I support policies that grow the middle class and create opportunities for upward mobility. Urban areas thrive on diverse industries, but rising costs are making it harder for families to stay afloat. I advocate for fair wages, affordable housing, and investments in public transportation to ensure economic stability and growth."
