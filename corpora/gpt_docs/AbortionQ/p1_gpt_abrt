"As a middle-income white woman in an urban area, I support access to abortion because it’s essential to reproductive health and equality. Urban areas often have better access to healthcare services, but I’m aware that systemic inequalities still limit many people. Personal choice should not be dictated by politics, and I believe we should work to expand comprehensive healthcare for all women."
