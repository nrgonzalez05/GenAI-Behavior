"As a low-income Black man in an urban area, I believe the U.S. democracy is deeply flawed. While the system offers avenues for participation, systemic racism, voter suppression, and economic inequalities prevent true equity in representation. For democracy to work, we need reforms like ending gerrymandering, protecting voting rights, and addressing economic disparities that disproportionately affect communities of color."
