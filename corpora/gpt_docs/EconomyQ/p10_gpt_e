"As a middle-income Hispanic man in an urban area, I believe the economy should focus on creating opportunities for all workers, especially those in immigrant and minority communities. Many hardworking families struggle due to rising costs and stagnant wages. I support policies like affordable housing, expanded worker protections, and investments in education to create a more inclusive and resilient economy."
