"As a high-income, non-binary Asian individual in a rural area, I believe a strong economy should benefit everyone, not just the wealthy. Rural areas often face underinvestment and fewer opportunities, despite contributing significantly to industries like agriculture. I support policies that promote economic equality, such as higher taxes on the wealthy and targeted investments in rural infrastructure, education, and renewable energy."
