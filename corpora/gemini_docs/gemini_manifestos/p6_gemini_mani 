I believe in a society where all people, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, have the opportunity to thrive. I believe in a government that truly represents the needs and aspirations of its citizens, particularly those who have historically been marginalized and underserved. I envision a future where Indigenous communities can reclaim their sovereignty, heal from historical trauma, and prosper on their own terms.

As a low-income American Indian woman living in a rural area, I bring a unique and deeply rooted perspective to the political landscape. I am a daughter, a mother, a community member, and a descendant of a long line of resilient people who have endured centuries of oppression and dispossession. I am deeply connected to my cultural heritage and committed to fighting for the rights and self-determination of my people.

Economic justice for Indigenous communities is paramount. Centuries of systemic discrimination and disenfranchisement have left many Indigenous communities struggling with poverty, unemployment, and lack of access to basic necessities. I advocate for policies that address these disparities, including investments in education, job training, and economic development programs specifically tailored to the needs of Indigenous communities. I support initiatives that promote tribal sovereignty and economic self-determination, such as supporting tribal businesses, expanding access to capital, and addressing the historical injustices that have hindered economic growth on reservations.

Protecting our land and natural resources is an inherent right and a fundamental responsibility. I believe in the importance of upholding treaty rights and respecting the sovereignty of tribal nations over their lands. I advocate for policies that protect our sacred lands from environmental degradation, including mining, logging, and other harmful industrial activities. I support the development of sustainable and environmentally responsible economic opportunities that benefit Indigenous communities and protect our natural resources.

Addressing the historical trauma experienced by Indigenous peoples is crucial for healing and reconciliation. I support policies that acknowledge and address the historical and ongoing impacts of colonization, including the forced displacement, cultural genocide, and systemic discrimination faced by Indigenous peoples. This includes investing in mental health services, supporting cultural revitalization efforts, and providing reparations for past harms.

Access to quality healthcare is a fundamental human right. I advocate for policies that improve access to quality healthcare services for all Indigenous people, including addressing disparities in healthcare outcomes, expanding access to mental health services, and investing in culturally competent healthcare providers. 

Education is the cornerstone of a strong and prosperous future. I support policies that invest in quality education for all Indigenous children, including culturally relevant curricula, increased funding for tribal schools, and programs that address the unique educational needs of Indigenous students. I believe in the importance of language revitalization efforts and supporting programs that promote cultural pride and identity.

Civic engagement and political participation are essential for empowering Indigenous communities. I advocate for policies that increase voter registration and turnout in Indigenous communities and support the development of Indigenous leadership in all levels of government. I believe in the importance of tribal self-governance and the right of Indigenous peoples to determine their own futures.

I believe that by working together, we can build a more just and equitable society where Indigenous communities can thrive. I am committed to fighting for the rights and self-determination of my people and working towards a future where all people can live in peace and prosperity.

I encourage you to consider my perspective and join me in the fight for a more just and equitable society for all.

Sincerely,

A Low-Income American Indian Woman Living in a Rural Area
