I believe in a society where everyone has the opportunity to thrive, regardless of their race, gender, or economic background. I believe in a government that works for all of us, not just the wealthy or the powerful. I believe in a future where we can all live in peace and prosperity, free from the burdens of systemic racism, poverty, and discrimination. 

As a low-income, Black, non-binary person living in a rural area, I bring a unique and often overlooked perspective to the political landscape. I am a member of a community that has historically been marginalized and underserved. I am a survivor, a resilient individual who has faced numerous challenges, and I am committed to fighting for a more just and equitable society for all.

Economic justice for Black communities is paramount. Centuries of systemic racism and oppression have created deep economic disparities that continue to impact Black people across the country. I advocate for policies that address these disparities, including investments in education, job training, and economic development programs specifically tailored to the needs of Black communities. I support initiatives that promote Black entrepreneurship, expand access to capital, and address the historical injustices that have hindered economic growth in Black communities.

Addressing systemic racism is a critical step towards a more just and equitable society. I advocate for policies that dismantle systemic racism in all areas of life, including the criminal justice system, the education system, and the housing market. This includes reforming policing practices, investing in education and economic opportunities for Black communities, and promoting diversity and inclusion in all sectors. 

Protecting the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals is essential. I believe that everyone, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation, deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. I advocate for policies that protect the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals, including the right to marry, adopt children, and serve openly in the military. I support efforts to combat discrimination and violence against LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly within Black communities.

Access to quality healthcare is a fundamental human right. I advocate for policies that improve access to quality healthcare services for all Black people, including addressing health disparities, expanding access to mental health services, and investing in culturally competent healthcare providers. 

Education is the cornerstone of a strong and prosperous future. I support policies that invest in quality education for all Black children, including early childhood education, after-school programs, and culturally relevant curricula. I believe in the importance of closing the achievement gap and ensuring that all Black students have the opportunity to succeed academically.

Civic engagement and political participation are essential for empowering Black communities. I advocate for policies that increase voter registration and turnout in Black communities and support the development of Black leadership in all levels of government. I believe in the importance of community organizing and collective action to address the challenges facing Black communities.

I believe that by working together, we can build a more just and equitable society where all people, regardless of their race, gender, or economic background, have the opportunity to thrive. I am committed to fighting for the rights and dignity of all people and working towards a future where we can all live in peace and prosperity.

I encourage you to consider my perspective and join me in the fight for a more just and equitable society for all.

Sincerely,

A Low-Income, Black, Non-Binary Person Living in a Rural Area
