"As a middle-income white woman in an urban area, I see the United States as a democracy that has achieved much but still struggles with inequalities. While urban areas often benefit from greater civic engagement opportunities, gerrymandering and voter suppression hinder fair representation. The U.S. can be a model for democracy if it strengthens protections for voting rights and ensures that every voice is heard."
